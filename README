# Iridium 9603 Lite USB #
#########################

An untested design for a very small, lightweight, USB-powered Iridium 9603 satellite communication module.
Dimensions are 35mm x 44mm x 18mm and the populated PCB will weigh close to 33g (including the antenna).

Python 2.7 code has been tested on Windows 10 and Debian Linux (Raspberry Pi).

The USB interface is provided by a Cypress CY7C65213 USB-UART Bridge.

Power for the Iridium 9603 is provided by a Linear Technology LTC3225EDDB supercapacitor charger.
